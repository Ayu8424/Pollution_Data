# 🌍 Pollution Analysis Project 💨

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **air pollution levels across different cities** using historical pollution data (2015 - 2020).  
The goal is to **identify trends, visualize key pollutants, and derive meaningful insights** using Python and data science techniques.

## ❓ Key Questions Explored
1. **How does pollution vary across different cities?** *(City-wise pollution level analysis)*
2. **What are the long-term trends in pollution levels over time?** *(Analyzing pollution patterns over the years)*
3. **How do pollution levels change on a monthly basis?** *(Monthly trends in pollutant concentrations)*
4. **What relationships exist between different pollutants?** *(Correlation analysis to identify key pollutant interactions)*
5. **Which are the top 10 most polluted cities based on PM2.5 levels?** *(Identifying the worst-affected cities by air pollution)*
6. **How have pollution levels changed over the years?** *(Studying pollutant trends from past to present)*

## 📈 Results & Findings
📍 **Major cities have high pollution levels**  
📍 **Seasonal variations observed** ❄️☀️  
📍 **PM2.5 & PM10 strongly correlate with traffic and industrial activities**  

### 🏙️ Top 5 Most Polluted Cities (Based on PM2.5 Levels)
1️⃣ **Delhi**  
2️⃣ **Patna**  
3️⃣ **Gurugram**  
4️⃣ **Lucknow**  
5️⃣ **Varanasi**

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
🚧 **Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data**  
Some data was missing or inconsistent, requiring **careful cleaning and preprocessing**.  

📊 **Creating Clear Visualizations**  
Making complex data **easy to understand** using the right charts and graphs was challenging.  

⚖️ **Balancing Depth vs. Simplicity**  
Had to decide **how deep** to go into each analysis while keeping the project **detailed yet concise**.

## 📌 Conclusion
🔹 **This analysis helped us understand air pollution trends across different cities.**  
🔹 **Delhi, Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow are among the most polluted cities.**  
🔹 **PM2.5 and PM10 are the major pollutants affecting air quality.**  
🔹 **Pollution levels peaked between 2015-2018 but started improving after 2019.**  
🔹 **Pollution levels drop mid-year, stay stable, and rise towards year-end.**  
🔹 **While air quality has improved in some cities, others still struggle with high pollution levels.**

## 📌 Future Scope 🚀
📍 **Extending the analysis to 2021-2025 data**  
📍 **Including meteorological data to study the impact of weather on pollution**  
📍 **Building predictive models for pollution forecasting**
